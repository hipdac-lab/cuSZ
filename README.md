cuSZ: CUDA-Based Error-Bounded Lossy Compressor for Scientific Data
---

cuSZ is a CUDA implementation of the world-widely used [SZ lossy compressor](https://github.com/szcompressor/SZ). It is the *first* error-bounded lossy compressor on GPUs for scientific data, which significantly improves SZ's throughput in GPU-based heterogeneous HPC systems. 
This document introduces the installation and use of cuSZ on NVIDIA GPUs. 

Our published papers cover the essential design and implementation.

</details>

<br/>

For CUDA 11.x, to compile,
```bash
git clone https://github.com/szcompressor/cuSZ.git cusz && cd cusz
chmod +x ./build.py  ## `./build.py -h` for help
./build.py -t TARGET [-T BUILD TYPE] [-b BACKEND]
```

For example, to build A100-specific binary, 
```
./build.py -t a100
```

- GPU targets include `a100`, `v100`, `p100`, `ampere`, `turing`, `pascal`
  - For the maximum compatibility, use `-t compat`. 
- Build types include `release` (default), `release-profile` (with `-lineinfo`) and `debug` (with `-G`).
- Build system backends include `make` (default) and `ninja`
- `build.py` installs `cusz` binary to `${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/bin`.
- `--purge` to clean up all the old builds.

Caveat: CUDA 10 or earlier, `cub` of a historical version becomes dependency. After `git clone`, please use `git submodule update --init` to patch.


<br/>

# use
## basic use

Type `cusz` or `cusz -h` for instant instructions. We give a basic use below.

```bash
## cusz -t <type> -m <mode> -e <error bound> -i <in> -l <len> -z (compress) --report time[,quality[,...]]
./bin/cusz -t f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/cesm-CLDHGH-3600x1800 -l 3600x1800 -z --report time
## cusz -i <cusz archive> -x [--compare -i <origin>] (decompress)
./bin/cusz -i ./data/cesm-CLDHGH-3600x1800.cusza -x
./bin/cusz -i ./data/cesm-CLDHGH-3600x1800.cusza -x --compare ./data/cesm-CLDHGH-3600x1800 --report time,quality
```

<!-- We use 1800-by-3600 (y-x order) CESM-ATM CLDHGH for demonstration, which is in preset and `-D cesm` can be alternatively used . Type `cusz` or `cusz -h` to look up the presets. -->

<!-- ```bash
cusz -t f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/cesm-CLDHGH-3600x1800 --demo cesm -z
``` -->

The following *essential* arguments are required,

- `-z` to compress; `-x` to decompress.
- `-m` to specify error control mode from `abs` (absolute) and `r2r` (relative to value range)
- `-e` to specify error bound
- `-i` to specify input file
- `-l <size>` to specify dimensions

## advanced use

<details>
<summary>
disabling modules
</summary>

- (in progress) To export quant-code, use `--skip huffman`
- For non-IO use, we can skip writing to disk during decompression using `--skip write2disk`.
- A combination of modules can be `--skip huffman,write2disk`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
additional lossless compression
</summary>

```bash
cusz -t f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/cesm-CLDHGH-3600x1800 -l 3600,1800 -z --gzip
```

</details>


<details>
<summary>
changing internal parameter
</summary>

syntax: `-c` or `--config quantbyte=(1|2),huffbyte=(4|8)`

- `quantbyte` to specify quant. code representation. Options `{1,2}` are for 1- and 2-byte, respectively. 
- `huffbyte` to specify Huffman codeword representation. Options `{4,8}` are for 4- and 8-byte, respectively. (Manually specifying this may not result in optimal memory footprint.)

</details>

<details>
<summary>
dry-run mode
</summary>


`--dry-run` or `-r` in place of `-z` and/or `-x` enables dry-run mode to get PSNR. This employs the feature of dual-quantization that the decompressed data is guaranteed the same as the prequantized data.

# FAQ

`*` There are implementation differences between CPU-SZ and cuSZ. Some technical detail is simplified. Please refer to our academic papers for more information.  

<details>
<summary>
How does SZ/cuSZ work?
</summary>

Prediction-based SZ algorithm comprises of 4 major parts

0. User specifies error-mode (e.g., absolute value (`abs`), or relative to data value magnitude (`r2r`) and error-bound.
1. Prediction errors are quantized/integerized in units of input error-bound (*quant-code*). A selected range of quant-codes are stored, whereas the out-of-range codes are otherwise gathered as *outlier*.
3. The in-range quant-codes are fed into Huffman encoder. A Huffman symbol may be represented in multiple bytes.
4. (CPU-only) additional DEFLATE method is applied to exploit repeated patterns. As of CLUSTER '21 cuSZ+ work, an RLE method performs a similar pattern-exploiting.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Why is there multibyte symbol for Huffman?
</summary>

The principle of Huffman coding is to guarantee high-frequency symbols with fewer bits. To be specific, given arbitray pairs of (symbol, frequency)-s, (*s<sub>i</sub>*, *f<sub>i</sub>*) and 
(*s<sub>j</sub>*, *f<sub>j</sub>*), the assigned codeword *c<sub>i</sub>* and *c<sub>j</sub>*, respectively, are guaranteed to have len(*c<sub>i</sub>*) is no greater than len(*c<sub>j</sub>*) if *f<sub>i</sub>* is no less than *f<sub>j</sub>*.

The combination of *n* single-byte does not reflect the fact that that quant-code that represents the `+/-1` error-bound should be of the highest frequency. For example, an enumeration with 1024 symbols can cover 99.8% error-control code (the rest 0.2% can result in much more bits in codewords), among which the most frequent symbol can dominate at over 90%. If singlebyte symbols are used, `0x00` from bytes near MSB makes

1. the highest frequency not properly represented, and
2. the pattern-exploiting harder. For example, `0x00ff,0x00ff` is otherwise interpreted as `0x00,0xff,0x00,0xff`.  

</details>

<details>
<summary>
What differs CPU-SZ and cuSZ in data quality and compression ratio?
</summary>

CPU-SZ offers a rich set of compression features and is far more mature than cuSZ. (1) CPU-SZ has preprocessing, more compression mode (e.g., point-wise) and autotuning. (2) CPU-SZ has Lorenzo predictor and Linear Regression, whereas cuSZ has Lorenzo (we are working on new predictors).

1. They share the same Lorenzo predictor. However, many factors affect data quality (and can be quality optimizers).
   1. preprocessing such as log transform and point-wise transform
   2. PSNR as a goal to autotune eb
   3. initial values from which we predict border values (as if padding). cuSZ predicts from zeros while SZ determines optimal values for, e.g., application-specific metrics. Also note that cuSZ compression can result in a significantly higher PSNR than SZ (with the same eb, see Table 8 on page 10 of PACT '20 paper), but it is not necessarily better when it comes to applications.
   4. The PSNR serves as a generic metric: SZ guarantees a lower bound of PSNR when the eb is relative to the data range, e.g., 64 for 1e-3, 84 for 1e-4.
2. The linear scaling can be the same. SZ has an extra optimizer to decide the linear scaling range $[-r, +r]$; out-of-range quantization values are outliers. This is to optimize the compression ratio.
3. Currently, the Huffman encoding is the same except cuSZ partitions data (therefore, it has overhead in padding bits and partitioning metadata).

|        | preprocess | Lorenzo predictor | other predictors | Huffman | DEFLATE     |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| CPU-SZ | x          | x                 | x                | x       | x           |
| cuSZ   | TBD        | x, dual-quant     | TBD              | x       | alternative |
</details>

<details>
<summary>
What is cuSZ+?
</summary>

cuSZ+ is referred to as the peer-reviewed work in 2021, on top of the original 2020 work.
cuSZ+ mixes the improvements in decompression throughput (by 4.3x to 18.6x) and the use of data patterns that are the source of compressibility. 
There will not be, however, standalone software or version for cuSZ+. We are gradually rolling out the production-ready functionality that is mentioned in the published paper.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
What is the future plan/road map of cuSZ?
</summary>

1. more predictors
2. more compression mode
3. both more modularized and more tight coupled in components
4. APIs (soon)

</details>

<details>
<summary>
How to know compression ratio?
</summary>

The archive size is compress-time known. The archive include metadata.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
How to know the performance?
</summary>

1. prior to CUDA 11: `nvprof <cusz command>`
2. CUDA 11 onward: `nsys profile --stat true <cusz command>`
3. enable `--report time` in CLI
4. A sample benchmark is shown at [`doc/benchmark.md`](https://github.com/szcompressor/cuSZ/blob/master/doc/benchmark.md). To be updated.

<summary>
limitations
</summary>

- `double` support not ready
- not API-ready
- to integrate faster Huffman codec
- 4-byte Huffman symbol may break; `--config huffbyte=8` is then needed.
- performance degradation regarding large-size datasets
- preprocessing not ready (e.g., binning, log-transform, normalization)
